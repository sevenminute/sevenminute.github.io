## ðŸŒ± About Seven Minute Journal

Hi! I'm a crowd tester from Indonesia who loves exploring apps and hunting bugs over coffee â˜•.

This journal is my little corner to log:
- Test cycles from uTest, TestIO, and others
- Bugs I find, both functional & usability
- Small lessons and reflections I pick up along the way

---

## ðŸ›  Devices & Languages

- **Devices:**  
  - Lenovo T740s (Windows 10)  
  - Infinix Note 40 (Android 15)

- **Languages:** Indonesian & English

## âœ¨ Why I created this journal

I noticed that writing down each bug, cycle, or small lesson helps me learn faster and explain better to others.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
