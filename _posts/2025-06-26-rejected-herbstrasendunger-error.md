## 🔍 Summary

While browsing the "Top Summersale Angebote" section of an e-commerce PWA, I encountered an error message when trying to open a product page for **Herbstrasendünger**. Despite clear user intent to view product details, the report was **rejected** as a duplicate.

---

## ❌ Rejection Reason

> **Duplicate Bug**  
> A similar issue had already been reported earlier in the same test.  
> Multiple product tiles in the "Rasenpflege Produkte" section triggered the same error behavior, and all instances were traced to the same root cause.

Since the underlying problem was already logged once, this report was not accepted as a unique finding.

## 💡 Lesson Learned

> 🔁 *Duplicate submissions often happen when the same bug manifests in different places.*  
Even if the trigger is different (e.g. another product or category), if the root cause is shared, **only one report will be accepted**.

Tips:
- Always check the list of known or similar bugs before submitting  
- Look for patterns — if multiple links or variants fail similarly, it may not be a new issue
